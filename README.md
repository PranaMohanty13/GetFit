### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category: Fitness**
- **Mobile:The app focuses on fitness tracking which could be done using a mobile device or a wearable due to the portability constraints associated with fitness**
- **Story: The app would encourage fitness amongst friends and peer in a closed social circle. The users would be motivated by friends to up their fitness and take part in challenges to earn their place in the leaderboard.**
- **Market: The app can be used by anyone interested in fitness and well being.**
- **Habit: It forms an habit around fitness and would be used by user daily to track and improve fitness.**
- **Scope: There are challenges as we would be using GPS like features to track the walks/runs, also we would be building REST API's whice time frame.**
